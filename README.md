# Meetup and Workshops in Pune
The idea behind this project is simple. We want it easier for community members in Pune to organize meetups and do this in a distributed way with some sort of a framework.

## How will this work?

- Select a type of [meetup / workshop from this list](https://github.com/wppune/meetups/blob/master/workshop-types.md).
- Select a [venue from this list](https://github.com/wppune/meetups/blob/master/venues.md).
- Contact the [Pune Meetup group for WordPress](https://www.meetup.com/Pune-WordPress-Knowledge-Exchange/) and get the meetup scheduled!

## Some rules first

- WordPress Meetups are for the benefit of the WordPress community as a whole, not specific businesses or individuals. All actions taken as an event organizer are with the best interest of the community in mind.

- Membership in the local meetup group is open to all who wish to join, regardless of ability, skill, financial status or any other criteria.

- Meetups are volunteer-run with volunteer speakers. In cases where a modest attendance fee might be necessary, this fee should only cover the costs of the meetup and shouldnâ€™t be used to pay speakers or organizers.

- Meetup groups allow events to be organized by any reliable/trusted member of the community.

- Meetups are welcoming places where everyone works to foster an accepting environment which is free of discrimination, incitement to violence, promotion of hate, and general jerk-like behavior.
